We used machine learning to predict whether a loan would be fully paid (healthy loan) or not fully paid (high-risk loan) based on various financial features like loan size, interest rate, borrower income, and others.

The logistic regression model performed very well, achieving 99% accuracy and strong performance in identifying both healthy and high-risk loans.
